This is powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) , a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines!

Django is a full-stack, open-source Python framework designed for efficient web development.

Why Django?
```
Django is a high-level Python web framework 
that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 

Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much 
of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing 
your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. 
Itâ€™s free and open source.
